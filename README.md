# deep-learned-embedding
A Deep-Learned Embedding Technique for Categorical Features Encoding

The folder contains many files, you can run this file by order:
1. data_loading.py
2. corpus_creation.py
3. preprocessing.py
4. reshape.py
 For each model, I have created separated files:
1. LR_model.py
2. GB_model.py
3. MLP_model.py
4. RF_model.py
5. LSTM_model.py
